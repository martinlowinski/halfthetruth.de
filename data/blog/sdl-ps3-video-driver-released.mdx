I&rsquo;m pleased to annouce the release of the <a href="http://libsdl.org/">libsdl</a> ps3 video driver I developed within my internship at IBM Germany. In fact, Dirk Herrendoerfer is hosting the patch and made a <a href="http://lists.libsdl.org/pipermail/sdl-libsdl.org/2009-April/069546.html">post</a> on the SDL mailinglist, thanks! Sam Lantinga (libsdl maintainer) has already applied the patch to subversion. To checkout the libsdl 1.2 svn tree, run <code>svn checkout http://svn.libsdl.org/branches/SDL-1.2</code> Feedback is most welcome.
