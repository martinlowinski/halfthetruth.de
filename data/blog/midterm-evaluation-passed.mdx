Last week, all GSoC students had to fill out the midterm evaluation form from Google which was basically a questionaire about how we&rsquo;re doing with our project. I&rsquo;m on schedule and enjoying working on my project and this is exactly what I wrote down &ndash; and I passed. So about 3-4 weeks are left for writing code, than passing the final evaluation and we&rsquo;re all done.
For checking out my progress so far, I have a subversion <a href="http://www.libsdl.org/cgi/viewvc.cgi/branches/gsoc2009_ps3/">branch on libsdl.org</a>.
