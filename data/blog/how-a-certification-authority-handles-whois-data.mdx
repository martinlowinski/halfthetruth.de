I just got a call from someone at <a href="http://comodo.com/">comodo.com</a> and the call went something like this<sup><a href="../2010/03/11/how-a-certification-authority-handles-whois-data/#fn12870367704caa288765c55">1</a></sup>:

<em>co:</em> I am [some name here] from comodo and looking for the owner of halfthetruth.de.
<em>me:</em> That&rsquo;s me.
<em>co:</em> Great. First I want to let you know that the ssl-certificate for halfthetruth.de has expired,
did you know that?
<em>me:</em> Jep.

Then a never ending story about what ssl-certs can do for you and your business and how many clients you&rsquo;ll get by buying a &ldquo;so great and cheap certificate from comodo.com&rdquo; &ndash; for only 300 euros (I forgot the exact number) per year.

So I told her, that halfthetruth.de is, as you can see, no business and I don&rsquo;t have clients to that not existing business and I just don&rsquo;t need a certificate from comodo.

<em>co:</em> Ok, can I ask you how much you paid for your certificate?
<em>me:</em> Nothing, it&rsquo;s for free.
<em>*pause</em>
<em>co:</em> Ok well, and how much do you pay for renewing the certificate?
<em>me:</em> It&rsquo;s for free as well, I can renew it anytime for free.[2]
<em>*pause</em>
<em>co:</em> Than you obviously don&rsquo;t need a certificate from comodo.
<em>me:</em> Absolutely right, just one question: Where did you get my phone number?
<em>co:</em> We have a research team doing that kind of stuff.
<em>me:</em> But I didn&rsquo;t post my phone number on my website or somewhere else publicly available.
<em>co:</em> Our research team is doing this, I got your phone number from them..

Then she asked me, if I want to give her my contact information so that she can forward some information regarding comodo and certificates and stuff. I declined politly and hang up. Apparently, they got my phone number from the whois service, but the information from the whois is not meant for advertising as you can see from the terms of use:

  Footnotes:
  <sup>1</sup> I cannot quote the exact words.
  <sup>2</sup> I&rsquo;m using a certificate from CAcert, which is free of charge and really great
  by the way.
