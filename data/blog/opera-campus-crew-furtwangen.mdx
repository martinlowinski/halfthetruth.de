[Mike](http://my.opera.com/bluemikeDE/about/) and [I](http://my.opera.com/mlowi/about/) founded the first [Opera Campus Crew](http://my.opera.com/CampusCrew/blog/) in Furtwangen this week. [The Opera Campus Crew](http://www.opera.com/company/education/campuscrew/) is a community outreach initiative to spread the word about Opera and Web standards on campuses and since we're using the Opera browser(s) heavily and hopefully doing some development with Opera Unite in the near future it&rsquo;s a good thing. Two weeks ago, a guy from Opera visited our uni and gave a presentation about the upcoming web standards. He was talking about [HTML5](http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html), stuff like canvas, svg and form-validation and how Opera is working on these features. It was a great talk, he gave us an excellent overview of the current and new challenges with web development and what's going on in the world of browsers.
