<a href="http://my.opera.com/bluemikeDE/about/">Mike</a> and <a href="http://my.opera.com/mlowi/about/">
  I
</a> founded the first <a href="http://my.opera.com/CampusCrew/blog/">Opera Campus Crew</a> in Furtwangen
this week. <a href="http://www.opera.com/company/education/campuscrew/">The Opera Campus Crew</a> is
a community outreach initiative to spread the word about Opera and Web standards on campuses and since
we&rsquo;re using the Opera browser(s) heavily and hopefully doing some development with Opera Unite
in the near future it&rsquo;s a good thing. Two weeks ago, a guy from Opera visited our uni and gave
a presentation about the upcoming web standards. He was talking about <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html">
  HTML5
</a>
, stuff like canvas, svg and form-validation and how Opera is working on these features. It was a
great talk, he gave us an excellent overview of the current and new challenges with web development
and what&rsquo;s going on in the world of browsers.
