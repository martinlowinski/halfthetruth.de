So this year&rsquo;s Google Summer of Code is officially over. The deadline for completing the final evaluations was already on Tuesday but the official results were announced on Wednesday: About 2000 mentors and 1000 students have been working on 150 projects with a success rate of 85%+ (including myself), which is the best success rate to date.

I really liked working with my mentor (thanks Sam!) on <a href="http://libsdl.org/">SDL</a> . Porting the ps3 video driver which I wrote last semester for SDL 1.2 to the new upcomming release SDL 1.3 was pretty exciting. Both video drivers have now the same functionality but I think the 1.3 ps3 driver has a better performance than the version in 1.2 (benchmarks comming soon). I hope I can continue working on SDL but unfortunately just as GSoC was over Sony anounced that the (new) PS3 will no longer have the &ldquo;otheros&rdquo;-feature, which is very sad. Therefor a lot of PS3 developers (like unsolo) stopped development on their projects (spumedia-lib, spexms, speutils, ...). But anyway, even if the ps3 community won&rsquo;t be the same again, GSoC was a great summer and you really get into open-source, all the things around it and you&rsquo;ll learn a lot.

Now, I am looking forward to get my GSoC-tshirt :-)
