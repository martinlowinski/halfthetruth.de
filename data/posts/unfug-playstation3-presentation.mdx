    content: "\t<p>@Jonathan: Great talk! &#8211; Jeremy&#8217;s code is a very good way to show how powerful the PS3 is.</p>\n\n\t<p>The PS3 support was removed from <span class=\"caps\">SDL</span> because there are only a very few people using it, not enough to keep it in the main project.</p>\n\n"

Today, I held a <a href="http://data.halfthetruth.de/studies/talks/ps3_031209.pdf">presentation</a> about programming on the PS3 at <a href="http://unfug.org/">UnFUG</a> . The content was the architecture of the Cell BE and how we can write code with good performance.
