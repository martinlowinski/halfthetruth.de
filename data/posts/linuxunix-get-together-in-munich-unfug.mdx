As you might know, there is <a href="http://unfug.org">UnFUG</a> (Unix Friends and User Group) in Furtwangen, which is basically a LUG for students at the <a href="http://www.hs-furtwangen.de">HFU</a>. UnFUG is a really great so called "Referat" and is organised by students (like me) every semester. But I switched uni and my new university, the <a href="http://in.tum.de">TUM</a>, doesn't have any user groups like this (except the LUGs from Munich). So Mike and I decided to somehow port UnFUG to Munich. We don't have a name yet, but we have a date, a room and a <a href="http://halfthetruth.de/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/linux-unix-get-together.pdf">flyer</a>.

We will have our first meeting on <strong>Wednesday, 3rd November at 7pm in room MI 00.13.009A</strong>, to present the idea and to organise the talks/workshops/etc. for the upcoming semester.
