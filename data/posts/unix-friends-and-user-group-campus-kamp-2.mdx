bq. In the beginning of summer semester 2008, the Unix Friends and User Group (<a href="http://unfug.org">UnFUG</a>) of the <a class="urlextern" title="http://www.hs-furtwangen.de/english/index_en.html" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.hs-furtwangen.de/english/index_en.html">University of Applied Sciences in Furtwangen</a> gathered together to discuss this semester&#8217;s topics. UnFUG has been having an evening per semester for some short speeches from different speakers for a couple of semesters - usually called &ldquo;pimp my x86&rdquo;. This semester though, an extraordinary large group of people had ideas for short speeches. The audience started joking around about a whole weekend filled with short speeches&hellip;
Well, a few weeks later has the organization for an actual three day event been started. UnFUCK, the Unix Friends and User Campus Kamp was created.

More information about the Unix Friends and User Group Campus Kamp is available on <a href="http://unfuck.eu">UnFUCK.eu</a>.
