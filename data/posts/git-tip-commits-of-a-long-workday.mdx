This is just a small tip for all git users out there. Usually, after a long workday, you want to briefly review the day before you leave the office. And who could tell you what you've done today better than git? It is a common practise to make small commits and commit often, which helps a lot in that case. With this config option (`~/.gitconfig`) you can simply run `git today` and get a nice and colorful list of the commits from today.. and than call it a day.

```bash
[alias]
  today = log --color --graph --pretty=format:'%Cred%h%Creset -%C(yellow)%d%Creset %s %Cgreen(%cr) %C(bold blue)<%an>%Creset' --after="yesterday" --abbrev-commit --
```

Update: It also includes commits that occured _after_ yesterday. An improved variant for this kind of scenario would be the following:

```bash
[alias]
  today = log --color --graph --pretty=format:'%Cred%h%Creset -%C(yellow)%d%Creset %s %Cgreen(%cr) %C(bold blue)<%an>%Creset' --since="6am" --abbrev-commit --
```
