# About #

My name is <a href="http://goldtopf.org">Martin Lowinski</a> and I'm a student & software developer from Freiburg, Germany. I am currently doing my Masters at the <a href="http://in.tum.de">TU Munich</a> and am about to start my Master Thesis about Multicore-Scheduling with Microkernels. Besides that I'm a freelancer developing web-applications.

This is my personal blog about basically everything I'm interested in and is worthy to spend some words about. Topics can vary from programming on Linux to administering a customers website or my experiences from the last holiday trip. So just in case you're more interested in a brief description of myself and an overview of my projects, take a look at my <a href="http://goldtopf.org">vcard</a>.
