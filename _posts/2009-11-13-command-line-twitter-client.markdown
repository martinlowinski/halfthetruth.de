Recently, I joined <a href="http://twitter.com/c0b0lt">twitter</a> and <a href="http://identi.ca/c0b0lt">identica</a> and was looking for a nice client for Linux. So I tried some Adobe Air  apps, GTK based twitter clients like gtktwitter or mibber &ndash; they all  look nice but it wasn&rsquo;t that kind of app I was looking for. Than I  stumbled upon an <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-friendfeed/index.html">article</a> on ibm developer about updating Twitter and FriendFeed from the command  line. This short but good article plus some research on how the Twitter  and Identi.ca feeds look like and I had a very basic bash script to  read and update twitter/identica which is kinda nice. It&rsquo;s still a bit  slow but I was surprised how easy it is to process rss feeds on the  bash.
