My rss-reader showed me a nice tip from MacOSXHints today: <a href="http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20110927204301998">How to use Quick Look on stacks</a>. Nothing special, but I tried it myself on the Downloads-stack and well... it worked as described. Since I have a some sourcecode-files in this folder and a quick look at these in its not so beautiful black-on-white design, I wondered if it is possible to enable syntax highlighting.

Few minutes later my favourite search engine showed me the link to this nice project: <a href="http://code.google.com/p/qlcolorcode/">qlcolorcode</a>. It's very easy to install (just copy it to <tt>~/Library/QuickLook)</tt> and it recognizes a lot of filetypes with the according colors for the statements.

Honestly I thought Quick Look is a closed environment (at least for the non-paying community) but there seems to be an API and even a <a href="http://www.quicklookplugins.com/">plugin repository</a> (and <a href="http://www.qlplugins.com/">another one</a>).
