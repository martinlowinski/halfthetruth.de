> Jekyll is a simple, blog aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory (representing the raw form of a website), runs it through Textile or Markdown and Liquid converters, and spits out a complete, static website suitable for serving with Apache or your favorite web server. This is also the engine behind GitHub Pages, which you can use to host your projectâ€™s page or blog right here from GitHub.

* Set up Jekyll (fork mojombo)
* Create archive pages for tags and categories
* Migrate comments on Wordpress to Disqus (via plugin)
* Import posts from Wordpress using the Jekyll importer with some additions
* Create some usefull rake tasts (compile, deploy, post, ...)
