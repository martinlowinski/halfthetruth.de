It was probably not the first time snowing this year but as I was driving (actually Beni was driving) to Fuwa we saw about 10-20cm snow at the roadside and snowy trees. You can really count on Fuwa, it's not even winter but it's freakin' cold and we have snow. Unfortunately not enough to go snowboarding but hey, the winter in fuwa is kinda long.
