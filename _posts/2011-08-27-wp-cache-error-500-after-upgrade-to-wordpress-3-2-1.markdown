WP-Cache seems to have some problems and produces 505 errors, at least on my and one <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/topic/wp-super-cache-causing-internal-server-error">other</a> server. I disabled it for now as dangadd5600 pointed it out in his post. It's too late to investigate that further, but hey.. I have the whole weekend for that.
