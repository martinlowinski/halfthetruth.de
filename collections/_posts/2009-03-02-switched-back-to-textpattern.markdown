As you have already noticed, the design has changed and with that the  backend too. About one year ago, I switched from textpattern to  wordpress because of plugins and usability. But unfortunately, wordpress  needs to many resources on my small 64MB virtual server and was really  slow (the backend even more than the frontend). So, from time to time  the server went out of memory. A webserver restart &ldquo;solved the problem&rdquo;  but it&rsquo;s only a workaround.
Now, I get back to textpattern. Textpattern is a lot faster but you have  to tweak a lot more by yourself than with wordpress. Another issue was  my Australia-blog: It was very difficult to set up a second article page  with wordpress (there might be a hack), because wordpress is designed  for one blog, it&rsquo;s not a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_content_management_system">CMS</a> (please correct me, if I&rsquo;m wrong).
Hope you enjoy it as much as I do.
