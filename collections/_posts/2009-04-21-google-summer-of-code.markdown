Yesterday, my proposal for Google Summer of Code 2009 was accepted. I  applied for doing further development on the PS3 video driver for the <a href="http://libsdl.org/">Simple DirectMedia Layer</a>. With me <a href="http://socghop.appspot.com/org/home/google/gsoc2009/sdl">three other students</a> have been accepted to work on projects like an Automated Test Suite,  International input for X11 and Mac OS X for SDL. Thanks to our mentors  and Google to make this possible.
